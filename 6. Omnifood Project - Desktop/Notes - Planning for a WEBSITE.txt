Designing a website is not just coding. IT's ABOUT PLANNING

DON'T START WRITING CODE BEFORE HAVING AN IDEA OF HOW THE SITE SHOULD LOOK LIKE

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS


1. DEFINE THE PROJECT
- define WHO the website is for ==> yourself? A client? Agency ?
- define WHAT the website is for ==> business and user goals
	- Business goal: Selling Premium Dog Food
	- User goal : Finding High-Quality dog food for good price
- define A TARGET audience ==> be specific if possible and makes sense for your website
	- TARGET AUDIENCE: Women, 20-40 yo, livining in Europe, over 2000E/month, passion for dogs


2. PLAN THE PROJECT - start thinking about the website
- PLAN AND GATHER WEBSITE CONTENT: copy (Text), images, videos, etc.
- Should be provided by the client 
- Plan the sitemap
	- what pages the site needs
	- how they relate to one another (content hierarchy)
- Plan the sections
	- based on the contenteach section on each page to convey the message to the user
- Define the WEBSITE PERSONALITY
	- based on the WEBSITE PERSONALITY framework


3. SKETCH LAYOUT AND COMPONENT IDEAS
- Think about what COMPONENTS you need, and how you can use them in LAYOUT PATTERNS (get inspiration in other web designs)
- Get ideas out of your head: VERY VERY IMPORTANT
	- PAN AND PAPER - very low fidelity - just some boxes
	- Figma (design software)
- Iterative process
	- keep experimenting with different components and layouts
- Don't make it perfect from the beginning


4. DESIGN AND BUILD
- Use decisions, content and sketches from 1, 2 and 3 and use them to DESIGN and BUILD THE WEBSITE HTML and CSS (designing in the browser)
- We already have the layout and components, so we need to design the actual VISUAL STYLE
- Visual Styles need to be based on the WEBSITE PERSONALITY, design guidelines and INSPIRATION
- use client's branding, if exists - COLORS, TYPOGRAPHY, ICONS


5. TEST and OPTIMIZE
- before actual lunch, we need to test and optimize the project
- Ensure the website works WELL IN ALL BROWSERS
- test on ACTUAL MOBILE DEVICES
- OPTIMIZE IMAGES
	- right dimensions
	- compress them
- Fix ACCESIBILITY (color contrast)
- PERFORMANCE TEST (ligthHouse in Chrome DevTools)
- SEO


6. LAUNCH
- share the project with the WORLD
- upload it to a hosting platform
- Free Plan - Netlify
- Buy a DOMAIN NAME - easy to write, memorable, represents the company


7. MAINTAIN AND UPDATE
- we need to keep the website content updated over time
- great chance for RECURRING REVENUE
- Install some Analytics SOFTWARE
	- Google Analytics
	- Fathom 
- A BLOG
	- a great way to keep users coming back
	- great for SEO
