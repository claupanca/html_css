DESING INGREDIENT #1 - Typography
- Serif vs Sans-Serif typefaces
	- Serif 	
		- small details at the end of the characters
		- traditional, clasic, good for long text
	- Sans-Serif
		- without the small lines
		- clean and simple
		- modern look and feel
	 	- easier to choose for beginners
- Design Toolbox
	- Google Fonts
	- Font Squirrel

1. Use good and popular typefaces
	- play it safe, don't use any crazy and weird typefaces
	- Sans-serif: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Montserrat, Work Sans, Lato
	- Serif: Merriwether, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora
	- USE ONLY 1 TYPEFACE for the page
2. Choose the right typeface for the website personality
	- decide between serif and sans-serif typeface
	- experiment with the typefaces
	- apply the typeface to the whole page and see the differences
3. Font Size
	- use a TOOLBOX - TYPE SCALE tool
	- NORMAL TEXT
		- between 16px and 32px
	- LONG TEXT (blog post)
		- 20px or even bigger
	- BIG HEADLINES
		- 50px+
		- BOLD = 600+ weight
	- Font Weight
		- don't use any font weight under 400(regular)
4. Reading Experience
	- Use less than 75 characters / line
	- Line Height 
		- normal text: between 1.5 and 2
		- big text: below 1.5
		- the smaller or longer the text, the LARGER the line height needs to be
	- Decrease the letter spacing
	- Use ALL CAPS for SHORT TITLE, make it SMALL, BOLD, Increase letter-spacing
	- DON'T JUSTIFY TEXT
	- DON'T CENTER LONG TEXTS


DESIGN INGREDIENT #2 - Colors
1. Make sure the colors match the website personality
	- Colors convey meaning
	- COLORS EXPLAINED IN THE LESSIONS PDF
2. Good COLOR TONE
	- TOOL BOX
		- OC- Open color
		- tailwind CSS

3. Color System
	- In any design we need at least 2 tyoew of colors 
		- MAIN color
			- the main color
		- GRAY color
			- a darker version of the main color

	- SHADES
		- darker versions
	- Toolbox - Tint & Shade Generator
5. MAIN COLOR
	- used to draw attention to the main ELEMENT of the page
		- CTA, logo, buttons
6. Use colors in images and illustrations
7. COLORS AND TYPOGRAPHY
	- on DARK COLOR background, we can use a TINT (lighter version) of the background
	- text should no be completely black
	- Don't make text too light 
		- use a tool to check the contrast between text and background colors
		- 4.5:1 for normal text
		- 3:1 for larger text

DESIGN INGREDIENT #3 - Images
1. Different types of images
	- PRODUCT PHOTOS
		- illustrate the producte we want to sell
	- STORYTELLING photos
		- convey the message of the website
		- related to the product
	- ILLUSTRATIONS
		- more abstract way of storytelling
	- PATTERNS
		- might appear as backgrounds
2. Use the images to support the message and the story
	- use images that really make a connection with your content	
3. Use original images
	- good looking stock images
	- high quality images
	- don't use fake images
	- TOOLBOX	
		- Unsplash
		- Pexels

7. TEXT ON IMAGES
	- darken or brighten the image where the TEXT is
	- use gradients
	- position the image in a neutral area
	- Put a text in a box and add opacity to the box
8. Account for HIG RES screens
	- size the images  as the actual dimension is DOUBLE 
	- if we want the displayed image to be 300 x 300, we need the original image to be 600 x 600
9. Compress images
	- TOOLBOX
		- Squoosh
	- compress all images 
10. When using multiple images side by side, use the same dimensions

- can add a lot of detail
- can change the look and feel of the entire page
1. GOOD ICON PACk
	- TOOLBOX
		- Phosphor icons
		- ionicons
		- icons8
2. NEVER MIX ICONS PACKS
3. Use SVG format of ICON FONTS, NOT png or jpg
4. Adjust to Web personality
	- use an icon pack that has a similar roundnedd and weight as the TYPOGRAPHY
5. When to use icons
	- use icons to provide assitance to text
	- build feature blocks (icon on top, heading, description)
	- connect them with BUTTONS
	- as bullet points
6. How to use Icons well
	- for low attention - set  the same color as text
	- for high attention - use different colors
	- icons need to make sense and FIT to the TEXT
	- not make icons LARGER than designed

ICONS Properties
	- stroke: #aaa -  COLOR
	- width:24px;
	- height: 24px

DESIGN INGREDIENT #5: Shadows
- shdows creates DEPTH, allow us to add a 3rd dimensions
- Shadows are calculated based on distance from the screen of the element
	- 2px away -  litte to no shadow
	- 6px away - a bit of shadow
	- 12px away - more shador
	- 24px away - even bigger shadow
- shadows can be used on boxes and text
1. Don't use shadows if don't fit site personality
	- Serious/ Elegant ==> no shadows to less shadows
	- Playful/ Fun ==> more shadows
2. Use shadows in small doses
	- Don't add shadows to every element
3. Go light on shadows
	- don't make them too dark
4. Small shadows for small elements
	- for EMAIL Forms we can use shadows
	- CTA's 
5. Medium shadows
	- used for entire sections to  float above the page
	- used on cards to stand up
6. Large Shadows
	- Navigations and Popup windows -  really large shadows
7. Experiment on different click interactions
	- like hover and click
8. Experment with glows
	- colored shadows

SHADOW CSS Property
- box-shadow: 1 2 3 4 5
	- 1 - offset horizontal length of the shadow : 20px
	- 2 - offset vertical length of the shadow: 10px
	- 3 - blur of the shadow: 20px
	- 4 - optional - scale the shadow up: 10px
	- 5 - color of the shadow - #000

- COLOR OF THE SHADOW
	- we format the color to rbgA(255,255,255,a)
	- we use 0.1 MAX

- we want the light source to come from the TOP
	- we set 1 (horizontal offset) - to 0

- If we set the blur to 0, the shadow will be a BOX
- 4 is ussually set to 0


DESIGN INGREDIENT #6: Border-radius 
- Serius/ Elegant ===> Less border-radius
- Playful/ Fun ===> More border-radius
1. Match the typeface roundness
2. Where top use border radius
	- buttons
	- images
	- around icons
	- standout sections


DESIGN INGREDIENT #7: Whitespace
- whitespace is space between elements
- Whitespaces communicates  how content is related to one another
- it creates invisible relationships between the elements of the layout

1. Use a TON of whitespace between SECTIONS
	- 192px for example
	- 140px
	- 160px

2. Between groups of elements in the SAME SECTION
	- 96px
	- 150px

3. Between smaller elements

4. Inside of groups of elements, use WHITESPACE instead of lines

5. Elements that belong together, should be closer
	- LAW of PROXIMITY

6. as a beginner - START WITH TOO MUCH WHITESPACE, and then remove it
	- START WITH WAY TO MUCH SPACE  
	
7. Match other design choices 
	-  BIG TEXT + BIG IMAGES = MORE WHITESPACE
	- small text + small images = less whitespace

8. USE A SYSTEM 	
	- 2px, 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px .....

DESIGN INGREDIENT #8: Visual Hierarchy
- all about establishing which elements of a desing are the most important ones
- is about drawing attention to the most imporatnt elements
- define a path for users, to guide them through the page
- a culmination of all the INGREDIENTS

1. Position imporatant elements closer to the top of the page
	- that's where they get the most attentions
	- attention flows from top to bottom

2. Images draw a lot of attention
	- use the mindfully

3. Use Whitespace strategically
	- extremely imporatnt to create visual hierarchy

VISUAL HIERARCHY of for TEXT ELEMENTS
4. Use a combination of font size, weight, color and whitespace
	- font color
	- backgrond color
	- font weight

5. We should emphasize 
	- titles
	- sub-titles
	- links
	- buttons
	- data points
	- icons

6. We should De-Emphasize
	- less important text
	- labels
	- secondary/ additional info

VISUAL HIERARCHY BETWEEN COMPONENTS
7. We acomplish it through a combination of
	- background colors
	- shadow
	- border

8. De-Emphasizing component B

9.Element to EMPHASIZE
	- testimonials
	- call to action sections
	- highlight sections
	- preview cards
	- forms
	- pricing tables
	- important rows/columns in tables


DESIGN INGREDIET #9: User Experience (UX)
- huge field

What is UI (user interface)?	
	- what it looks and feels like
What is UX (user experience)?
	- how it works

UX Design - IT"S ALL ABOUT GOALS
	- a website or application EXISTS FOR A REASON	
	- a user has a GOAL of visiting the PAGE
	- a business has a GOAL of creating the PAGE
	- the main GOAL IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN THESE 2

PRACTICAL UX guidelines
1. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use patterns that users know
-	- there is nothing wrong with the sites that look the same
	- that's a good thing, the users get to know the site
	
2. Make the CTA the most proemintent element, and make the text descriptive
	- make the CTA a standout

3. Use BLUETEXT and UNDERLINE ONLY ON LINKS
	- users are really used to BLUE and UNDERLINE as LINKS, so don't use it on anything else

4. Animation should have a PURPOSE and be FAST -  between 200ms and 500ms

5. Align labels and FIELDS in 1 vertical line for FORMS

6. Offer good feedback for all FORM ACTIONS

7. LAW OF LOCALITY
	- a button that will do something NEEDS TO BE PLACED WHERE IT HAS AN EFFECT	
	- 

UX RULES for CONTENT
1. Write a descriptive headline on the main page
	- use a descriptive
	- keyword-focused headline about the business

2. Only include relevant information
	- cut out all the fluff
	- make content 100% clear

3. Use SIMPLE WORDS
	- avoid technical jargon
	- avoid smart-sounding words

4. Break a LONG TEXT using
	- sub-headings
	- images
	- block quoutes
	- bullet points


STEAL LIKE AN ARTIST
- NOT COPY entire desing.
	- TAKE GOOD PARTS AND adapt them to our needs
